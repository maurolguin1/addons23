Canvas Business


Business model canvas, translated as a business model canvas,
is a strategic management template for the development of new models of
business or document existing ones. It is a visual graphic with elements that
describe the product or value proposal of the company, the infrastructure,
Customers and finances. It helps companies to align their activities through
the illustration of possible compensations. The business model of the canvas was
initially proposed by Alexander Osterwalder1 on the basis of his work
previous on the ontology of business models. Since the publication of
the work of Osterwalder in 2008, new canvases have appeared for specific niches,
like the Lean Canvas. The formal descriptions of the business become the blocks
of construction for their activities. There are many different conceptualizations of
deal; The work of Osterwalder and thesis (2010, 2004) propose a unique model of
reference based on the similarities of a wide range of model conceptualizations
of business. With your business model template design, a company can describe
easily your business model.
